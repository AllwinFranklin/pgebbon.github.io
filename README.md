JavaScript file for playerjs web player

Thought I should write a good description of the content I have here on GitHub

I became fascinated by the IPTV / Web TV in year 2017
I could see so many Christian and family related streaming content and thought why not build an app to bring all together in a single place 

I made a collection of stream and first created

m3u file. There were some good free apps that were then useful to play the content.

I got more interested with the development in HTML5 video content and the flexibility it offers to adapt to both iOS and Android platform and even PC playback 
Also with broadband Internet services and the smart television with bigger screen I saw that the best way would be to have it in HTML5 that can easily fit to any device 

I tried a few apps but they were either paid service or not suitable so had been looking for doing it on my own.

PlayerJS - Ever since I came to know this excellent html video player I started seeing the possibilities. By 2020 half of the streaming content I had had http protocol or incompatible format 
This began to change towards the end of 2020 and now almost every stream I have is playable 

https://playerjs.com/ Biggest advantage of this player is multiple stream can be combined easily and passing a playlist to the player brings all the content in one place. I first developed
my site from blogger and was hosting the java script file here at GitHub

Recently @allwin helped me host the content as well in a good looking manner at GitHub itself.
