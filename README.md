Thought I should write a good description of the content I have here on GitHub

I became fascinated by the IPTV / Web TV in year 2017
I could see so many Christian and family related streaming content and thought why not build an app to bring all together in a single place 

I made a collection of stream and first created

m3u file. There were some good free apps that were then useful to play the content.

I got more interested with the development in HTML5 video content and the flexibility it offers to adapt to both iOS and Android platform and even PC playback 
Also with broadband Internet services and the smart television with bigger screen I saw that the best way would be to have it in HTML5 that can easily fit to any device 

I tried a few apps but they were either paid service or not suitable so had been looking for doing it on my own.
